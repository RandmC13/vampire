# hamrvis

Viewer for VAMPIRE heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) simulations: the relaxation, the write and the
read-back of a run, on one down-track axis.

It has two parts:

1. **`hamrvis reduce`** turns finished run directories into a compact *bundle*. It runs where the data is (on the
   cluster), so only the bundle is copied home. The 90 GB of spin snapshots of a 8.7M-atom write become about
   about 2.2 GB, or about 180 MB without the per-layer data (estimated from the final snapshot).
2. **`hamrvis view`** serves one general viewer for any bundle on `localhost` and opens it in the browser. The
   same viewer works for every run, so improvements apply to old runs too.

Only Python 3.8+ with numpy is needed; the viewer is plain HTML and JavaScript with no build step.

## Typical workflow

On Viking, after the chain has finished (`<chain>` holds `relax/`, `write/`, `read/`):

```bash
cd ~/hamrvis                        # a clone of this repository
sbatch --account=<project> scripts/viking-reduce.job <chain> ~/scratch/bundles/<name>
```

On the laptop:

```bash
rsync -av --info=progress2 viking:scratch/bundles/<name> ~/hamr-bundles/
python3 -m hamrvis view ~/hamr-bundles/<name>         # opens http://127.0.0.1:8737/
```

For a run on your own machine, reduce it directly: `python3 -m hamrvis reduce runs/my-run -o bundles/my-run`.

To share a run as one file (for example with a supervisor, or as a claude.ai artifact):

```bash
python3 -m hamrvis export bundles/<name> -o <name>.html --grain-step 8      # must stay under 16 MB for claude.ai
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m hamrvis reduce <runs...> -o <bundle>` | `<runs>`: run directories, or a folder whose subfolders are run directories. Each run is classified as relax, write (`sim:program = hamr-simulation`) or read (dipole field output) from its input. Options: `--no-volume` (skip per-layer data, ~10x smaller), `--every N` (keep every N-th snapshot), `--tc K` (freezing temperature for the analysis; measured by default), `--name`, `-j N` (parallel workers). |
| `python3 -m hamrvis view <bundle>` | Serves the viewer and the bundle on `127.0.0.1:8737` (`-p` to change). |
| `python3 -m hamrvis export <bundle> -o page.html` | One self-contained page. `--grain-step N` keeps every N-th grain frame, `--snap-step N` every N-th snapshot, `--no-volume`, `--artifact` (no document skeleton, for claude.ai). |
| `python3 -m unittest discover tests` | Tests (needs node for the viewer-model test). |

## What the run needs to write

The reducer reads what VAMPIRE writes; the more of it there is, the more the viewer shows.

| Input keywords | Gives |
|---|---|
| `output:column-headers`, `output:real-time`, `output:magnetisation` | The time line under the transport bar (required: `output` must have column headers) |
| `grain:real-time`, `grain:magnetisation`, `grain:output-rate` | Grain view, grain life stories, space-time diagram, write analysis |
| `create:grain-shape-output` | Grain outlines |
| `config:atoms`, `config:atoms-output-rate`, `config:output-format = binary` | Atom-column view, one-layer view, cross-section, lowest-\|m\| map |
| `dipole:output-dipole-field` (read stage) | Stray-field map, field section, read-back waveform |
| `output:applied-field-strength` | Not needed: the head field is rebuilt from the input, exactly as VAMPIRE applies it |

## Runs it adapts to

Nothing is tied to one run. The reducer reads everything from the run's own files:
- tracks, bits per track and the bit sequence follow VAMPIRE's rules (`hamr:number-of-bits`, `track-size`,
  `track-padding`, single-tone or user-defined sequences, field-free `0` bits);
- the head field follows `sim:min/maximum-applied-field-strength`, rise/fall times and the field direction;
- `grain.txt` columns follow the input's `grain:` keywords in order (`time-steps` or `real-time` etc.);
- snapshots in binary or text, single file or one file per node or process; truncated copies are skipped with a
  warning;
- the grids adapt to the lattice and size: atom columns at the atomic pitch up to 4M pixels, then coarser; layers
  at 2 x 2 sites (`--layer-factor 1` stores every atom) up to 2.5M cells per snapshot, then coarser;
- grain shapes come from the atoms' grain IDs; coordinate files without grain IDs (older VAMPIRE text format)
  fall back to the Voronoi outlines, labelled approximate.

Tested on the H3 Viking chain (1 track, 33 bits, binary file-per-node, 8.7M atoms) and the 2026-10-15 overnight
run (2 tracks x 11 bits with field-free edge bits, text snapshots, film cut by a geometry file, 1.6M atoms).

## How much is kept

Everything VAMPIRE writes per grain (`grain.txt`, every frame) and per run (`output`) is kept at full time resolution.
Every spin snapshot is kept (none are dropped unless `--every` is given), reduced to the mean spin of the magnetic
atoms in each 0.25 nm column through the film and in each 0.5 nm x 0.5 nm cell of every atomic layer, stored to
1/127 per component. The reducer checks itself on every run and records the result (shown under Run details): each
stored value against the exact mean, and each snapshot's per-grain average against `grain.txt`. Grain shapes are
taken from the atom positions, not from VAMPIRE's Voronoi outlines. See `docs/decisions.md` (Accuracy).

## Viewer

- **Stages**: relax, write and read-back, as a chain at the top right. The address ends in `#write` etc., so a
  stage can be bookmarked.
- **Lanes** share the film's x axis; hovering any lane draws one crosshair through all of them.
  - *Bits*: intended bits of the track under the section line, shifted upstream by the freeze lag, with the
    melted grains pointing along their bit's field at the current time (green) under each.
  - *Film*: grains (shapes from the atoms), atom columns (through-thickness average) or one atomic layer; coloured
    by m_z, m_z against the intended bit (never-melted grains grey), peak laser temperature or the lowest |m|
    reached. Laser isotherms (bold: freezing temperature) and the head-field box with its direction and strength.
    The dashed line is the section line: click the film to move it. *Bit cells* overlays every bit's region on
    every track and the band hotter than the freezing temperature (the part of the track that can be written).
    Atom views show the nearest snapshot; its time is printed on the image when it differs from the timeline.
  - *Transport* directly under the film: start / play / end (Home, space, End), 0.1x to 30x, step (arrow keys,
    shift for 50 frames).
  - *x–z section*: slice through the section line from the nearest snapshot (height x2).
  - Read stage: *stray field* B_z at a chosen sensor height, *field section* (x–z), *read-back* waveform (mean B_z
    across a reader band of chosen width) with the intended transitions.
- **Inspector**: hover a grain, or click to keep it: outcome, decision moment and circumstances, and its life story
  (laser temperature, |m|, m_z, field felt). Click the chart to jump there.
- **Space–time**: one row per melted grain (or all), sorted by x, time left to right; dashed: laser passes the
  grain; tick: decision moment. Click to select the grain and jump to that time.
- **Analysis** (write): success, freezing temperature and lag, where each grain froze, outcomes by circumstance.
- **Save PNG** stacks the lanes into one image (local viewer only).

Colours: magnetisation is blue (down) to red (up); fields are green (down) to purple (up), so a field never reads
as magnetisation; written-as-intended is green, wrong is ochre.
